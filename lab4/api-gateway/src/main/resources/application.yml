# Explanation
# In spring cloud gateway, multiple retry failures in one request will be considered as one failure in circuit breaker,
# and the timeout duration is the maximum timeout duration of all retries.
# This is different from resilience4j, where multiple retry failures in one request will be considered as multiple failures in circuit breaker,
# and the timeout duration is for each retry.
